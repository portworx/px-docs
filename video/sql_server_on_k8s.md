In this five-minute hands-on video, you’ll learn how simple it is to run Microsoft SQL Server in Kubernetes with Portworx. 
You'll see how to achieve database reliability, recoverability, and high availability 
without having to configure multiple clustered SQL Server instances.

Microsoft SQL Server is widely regarded as the gold standard for Enterprise database service. 
And the docker version of MS SQL Server is the most significant indication how just how important Microsoft views containers.
Yet some of the hardest problems to solve for containers have been high-availability, data persistence, and data recoverability.

without having to configure multiple SQL Server instances in clustered or hot-standby mode.
