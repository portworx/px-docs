This guide walks through updating Portworx deployed as a DaemonSet in a Kubernetes cluster.

In the current version, Portworx recommends following an update strategy of 'OnDelete'. With 'OnDelete' update strategy, after you update a DaemonSet template, new DaemonSet pods will only be created when you manually delete old DaemonSet pods. Doing so gives end users more control on when they are ready to update Portworx on a particular node.

Users are expected to migrate application pods using Portworx volumes to another node before deleting the old Portworx pod.

Follow the below sequence to update Portworx in your cluster.

### 1. Ensure that the DaemonSet update strategy is "OnDelete"

* Check current update strategy using command: `$ kubectl get ds portworx -n kube-system -o yaml | grep -A 3 updateStrategy:`
* If the updateStrategy type is `RollingUpdate`, change it to the `OnDelete`
    * Edit the spec using command: `$ kubectl edit ds portworx -n kube-system`
    * This will open the spec in an editor. Change updateStrategy to `OnDelete` and save the file. This section in your spec should look like below:
        ```yaml
        updateStrategy:
            type: OnDelete
        ```

### 2. Update the Portworx image in the spec

* Change the image of the Portworx Daemonset with command: `$ kubectl set image ds portworx portworx=portworx/px-enterprise:1.2.9 -n kube-system`
    * Above command changes the Portworx container image to our 1.2.9 release.
* Alternately, you can also change the image in the DaemonSet spec file and apply it using `$ kubectl apply -f <px-spec.yaml>`.

### 3. Update Portworx pods

It is not recommended to delete the Portworx pod while an application is actively issuing I/O. This can induce race conditions in docker causing it to hang. 

The following procedure should be followed:
1. Cordon the node where you want to upgrade Portworx: `$ kubectl cordon <node-name>`
2. Delete application pods running on this node that are using Portworx volumes: `$ kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`
    * Since application pods are expected to be managed by a controller like `Deployement` or `StatefulSet`, Kubernetes will spin up a new replacement pod on another node.
3. Delete Portworx pod running on this node. This will start a new Portworx pod on this node with the new version you set above. (Note: Cordoning a kubernetes node doesn't affect DaemonSet pods)
4. Reboot the node. (Portworx 1.2.9 release requires a reboot of the host to perform upgrade of our kernel driver.)
5. Uncordon the node once it comes up.

>**Coming soon:**<br/> In the 1.2.10 release, Portworx will be automating the above procedure by closer integration with the Kubernetes API.
