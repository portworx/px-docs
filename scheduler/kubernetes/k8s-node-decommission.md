This guide describes a recommended workflow for decommissioning a Portworx node in your Kubernetes cluster.

### 1. Migrate application pods using portworx volumes that are running on this node
If you plan to remove Portworx from a node, applications running on that node using Portworx need to be migrated. If Portworx is not running, existing application containers will end up with read-only volumes and new ones will fail to start.

You have 2 options for migrating applications.
##### Migrate all pods
* Drain the node using: `kubectl drain <node>`

##### Migrate selected pods
1. Cordon the node using: `kubectl cordon <node>`
2. Delete the application pods using portworx volumes using: `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`
    * Since application pods are expected to be managed by a controller like `Deployement` or `StatefulSet`, Kubernetes will spin up a new replacement pod on another node.

### 2. Decommission Portworx
1. Follow [this guide](/maintain/scale-down.html) to decommission the Portworx node from the cluster.
2. Stop the portworx systemd service: `kubectl label nodes <node> px/service=stop --overwrite`. _This step is required only if PX is deployed as OCI_.
3. Disable the portworx systemd service: `kubectl label nodes <node> px/service=disable --overwrite`. _This step is required only if PX is deployed as OCI_.
4. Set the `px/enabled` label to `false` on the node using: `kubectl label nodes <node> px/enabled=false --overwrite`
    * This will remove the Portworx container from this node since the Portworx DaemonSet spec file uses a node anti-affinity rule that causes it to _not_ run on nodes that have the label: `px/enabled=false`
    * If you have an older Portworx DaemonSet spec, ensure the spec has the following section.
    ```yaml
        spec:
          affinity:
            nodeAffinity:
              requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                nodeSelectorTerms:
                - matchExpressions:
                  - key: px/enabled
                    operator: NotIn
                    values:
                    - "false"
    ```
    * You can use `kubectl edit ds portworx -n kube-system` to update the spec or if you have a saved spec file, update the file and `kubectl apply` it. 

>**Decommission from Kubernetes:**<br/> If the plan is to decommission this node altogether from the Kubernetes cluster, no further steps are needed.

### 3. Ensure application pods using Portworx don't run on this node
If you need to continue using the Kubernetes node without Portworx, you will need to ensure your application pods using Porworx volumes don't get scheduled here.

One way to achieve is this to use [inter-pod affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity-beta-feature)
* Basically we will define a pod affinity rule in your applications that ensure that application pods get scheduled only on nodes where the Portworx pod is running.
* Consider below nginx example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      affinity:
        # Inter-pod affinity rule restricting nginx pods to run only on nodes where Portworx pods are running (Portworx pods have a label
        # name=portworx which is used in the rule)
        podAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: name
                operator: In
                values:
                - "portworx"
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
            namespaces:
            - "kube-system"
      hostNetwork: true
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: nginx-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      volumes:
      - name: nginx-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: px-nginx-pvc
```

### 4. Uncordon the node
You can now uncordon the node using: `kubectl uncordon <node>`
