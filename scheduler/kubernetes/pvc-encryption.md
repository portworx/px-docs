[Encryption at Storage Class level](/scheduler/kubernetes/storage-class-encryption.html) does not allow using different secret keys for different PVCs. It also does not provide a way to disable encryption for certain PVCs that are using the same secure storage class. Encryption at PVC level will override the encryption options from Storage Class.

PVC level encryption is achieved using following PVC annotations:
- `px/secure` - Boolean which tells to secure the PVC or not
- `px/secret-name` - Name of the secret used to encrypt
- `px/secret-namespace` - Namespace of the secret (Kubernetes Secrets only)
- `px/secret-key` - Key to be used in the secret (Kubernetes Secrets only)

### Encryption using cluster wide secret
{% include_relative set-cluster-wide-secret.md %}

#### Step 2: Create the secure PVC
If your Storage Class does not have the `secure` flag set, but you want to encrypt the PVC using the same Storage Class, then create the PVC as below:
```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: secure-pvc
  annotations:
    px/secure: "true"
spec:
  storageClassName: portworx-sc
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

As there is no `px/secret-name` annotation specified, Portworx will default to the cluster wide secret to encrypt this PVC. If the cluster wide secret is not set, the volume creation will fail until the key is set.

Similar to the above example, if you want to use a Storage Class with `secure` parameter set, but do not want to encrypt a certain PVC, then set the `px/secure` annotation to `false`.

>**Note:** If you are running Kubernetes version older than 1.9.4 (or < 1.8.9 in Kubernetes 1.8), then the PVC name has to be in `ns.<namespace_of_pvc>-name.<identifier_for_pvc>` format to use the PVC-level encryption feature.

### Encryption using custom secret key

#### Kubernetes secrets
You can encrypt your PVC using a custom secret as follows:
```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: secure-mysql-pvc
  annotations:
    px/secret-name: volume-secrets
    px/secret-namespace: portworx
    px/secret-key: mysql-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: portworx-sc
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

The encrypted PVC will use the key `mysql-pvc` under the Kubernetes secret `volume-secrets` in `portworx` namespace. If the secret key is not present, then the volume creation will fail until the key is created.

From the annotations in the above PVC, only `px/secret-name` is mandatory.
- If you do not specify the `px/secret-namespace`, Portworx will look for the secret in the PVC's namespace.
- If you do not specify the `px/secret-key`, Portworx will look for a key with the PVC name.

##### (Optional) Different namespace to store secret keys
By default, Portworx has permissions to read secrets under `portworx` namespace. If your secrets are stored in some other namespace, then you need to give Portworx permissions to read the secrets. To grant Portworx permission to read `vol-secrets` secret, under `example` namespace, do the following:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
# Role to access 'vol-secrets' secret under 'example' namespace
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: px-vol-enc-role
  namespace: example
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  verbs: ["get"]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  resourceNames: ["vol-secrets"]
---
# Allow portworx service account to access the secret
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: px-vol-enc-role-binding
  namespace: example
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: px-account
  namespace: kube-system
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: px-vol-enc-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
EOF
```
