## Interactive Tutorial

Follow [this interactive tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/deploy-px-k8s) to get a high level overview on installing Portworx on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

{% include k8s-prereqs.md %}.

## Install

Portworx gets deployed as a [Kubernetes DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). Following sections describe how to generate the spec files and apply them.

#### Generating the spec

{% include k8s-spec-generate.md %}

#### Applying the spec

Once you have generated the spec file, deploy Portworx.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f px-spec.yaml
```

{% include k8s-monitor-install.md %}

## Deploy a sample application

Now that you have Portworx installed, checkout various examples of [applications using Portworx on Kubernetes](/scheduler/kubernetes/k8s-px-app-samples.html).
