Portworx can run alongside Kubernetes and provide Persistent Volumes to other applications running on Kubernetes. This section describes how to deploy PX within a Kubernetes cluster and have PX provide highly available volumes to any application deployed via Kubernetes.

>**Note:**<br/>OpenShift and Kubernetes Pre 1.6 users, please follow [these instructions](flexvolume.html).

## Deploy PX with Kubernetes 1.6+
Kubernetes-1.6 [release](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.6.0) includes the Portworx native driver support which allows Dynamic Volume Provisioning. 

The native portworx driver in Kubernetes supports the following features:
1. Dynamic Volume Provisioning
2. Storage Classes
3. Persistent Volume Claims
4. Persistent Volumes

## Prerequisites
* You must have a running Kubernetes 1.6+ Cluster.  If your Kubernetes cluster is older than 1.6, follow [these](flexvolume.html) instructions to run Kubernetes with flexvolume (not recommended and has limited features).
* You *must* configure Docker to allow shared mounts propogation. Please follow [these](/knowledgebase/shared-mount-propogation.html) instructions to enable shared mount propogation.  This is needed because PX runs as a container and it will be provisioning storage to other containers.
* Ensure all nodes running PX are synchronized in time and NTP is configured

## Install
>**Note:**<br/>If you are deploying Kubernetes using [Tectonic](https://coreos.com/tectonic/), read the [known issue here](#tectonic-known-issue).

The following kubectl commands deploys Portworx in the cluster as a `DaemonSet`:
```
$ curl -o px-spec.yaml "http://install.portworx.com?cluster=mycluster&kvdb=etcd://etc.company.net:4001"
$ kubectl apply -f px-spec.yaml
```
Make sure you change the custom parameters (_cluster_ and _kvdb_) to match your environment.

Below are all parameters that can be given in the query string:

#### Scaling
Portworx is deployed as a `Daemon Set`.  Therefore it automatically scales as you grow your Kubernetes cluster.  There are no additional requirements to install Portworx on the new nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.

#### Examples
```
# To specify drives
$ kubectl apply -f "http://install.portworx.com?cluster=mycluster&kvdb=etcd://etcd.fake.net:4001&drives=/dev/sdb,/dev/sdc"

# To run on coreos
$ kubectl apply -f "http://install.portworx.com?cluster=mycluster&kvdb=etcd://etcd.fake.net:4001&coreos=true"

# To run in master in zero storage mode and use a specific drive for other nodes
$ kubectl apply -f "http://install.portworx.com?cluster=mycluster&kvdb=etcd://etcd.fake.net:4001&zeroStorage=true&drives=/dev/sdb"
```

## Uninstall
Following kubectl command uninstalls Portworx from the cluster.

```
$ kubectl delete -f "http://install.portworx.com?cluster=mycluster&kvdb=etcd://etcd.fake.net:4001"
```

>**Note:**<br/>During uninstall, the configuration files (/etc/pwx/config.json and /etc/pwx/.private.json) are not deleted. If you delete /etc/pwx/.private.json, Portworx will lose access to data volumes.

## Cloud Installation
Portworx-ready Kubernetes clusters can be deployed through Terraform, using the Terraporx repository, on Digital Ocean and Google Clould Platform

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
To deploy a Portworx-ready Kubernetes cluster on GCP, use [this Terraporx repository](https://github.com/portworx/terraporx/tree/master/gcp/kubernetes_ubuntu16)

### Digital Ocean
To deploy a Portworx-ready Kubernetes cluster on Digital Ocean, use [this Terraporx repository](https://github.com/portworx/terraporx/tree/master/digital_ocean/kubernetes_ubuntu16)


## Known issues

<a name="tectonic-known-issue"></a>
##### Kubernetes on CoreOS deployed through Tectonic
[Tectonic](https://coreos.com/tectonic/) is deploying the [Kubernetes controller manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/) in the docker `none` network. As a result, when the controller manager invokes a call on http://localhost:9001 to portworx to create a new volume, this results in the connection refused error since controller manager is not in the host network.
This issue is observed when using dynamically provisioned Portworx volumes using a StorageClass. If you are using pre-provisioned volumes, you can ignore this issue.

To workaround this, you need to set `hostNetwork: true` in the spec file `modules/bootkube/resources/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` and then run the tectonic installer to deploy kubernetes.

Here is a sample [kube-controller-manager.yaml](https://gist.github.com/harsh-px/106a23b702da5c86ac07d2d08fd44e8d) after the workaround.

This issue will be fixed in upcoming kubernetes release 1.6.5.
