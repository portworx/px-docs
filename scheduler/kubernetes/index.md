Portworx can run alongside Kubernetes and provide Persistent Volumes to other applications running on Kubernetes. This section describes how to deploy PX within a Kubernetes cluster and have PX provide highly available volumes to any application deployed via Kubernetes.

Since Kubernetes [v1.6 release](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.6.0), Kubernetes includes the Portworx native driver support which allows Dynamic Volume Provisioning.

Portworx supports the following features in Kubernetes:

1. Dynamic Volume Provisioning with Storage Classes, Persistent Volume Claims and Persistent Volumes
2. Snapshots and Restores
3. Encryption
4. Hyper-convergence
5. Scheduler extensions with Stork
6. Rolling upgrades
