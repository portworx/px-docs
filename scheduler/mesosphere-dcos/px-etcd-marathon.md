Portworx version through 1.2 depend on an external key-value datastore (e.g. etcd or consul) for cluster topology.
To simplify deployment of Mesosphere/DCOS for these environments, the following converged Marathon application group
definition can be used.

## Converged Marathon Application Group

To deploy the converged Portworx/etcd application group:

* Download the DCOS CLI
* Download the [px_etcd.json file](/px_etcd.json?raw=true)
* Run the command : `dcos marathon group add px_etcd.json`

The `px_etcd.json` file assumes that :

* Portworx will use all disks/partitions that are not currently mounted or in use
* The same network interfaces will be used for `mgmt` and `data` traffic

If customization is needed here, then users should update the `args` section for the `portworx` definition
to provide more specific [command line arguments](/install/docker.html#run-px).
