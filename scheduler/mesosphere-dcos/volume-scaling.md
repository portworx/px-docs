DCOS via Marathon allows scaling the number of instances of applications. However, when these applications require data volumes, there is no way to associate instances to data volumes.

`volume-sets` allows re-use of the same volume name for all container instances by performing on-demand creation of volumes as user containers get scheduled on different nodes. Each instance of a container gets a unique instance of a data volume.

In runtime, a node may fail and applications get respawned on different nodes. With `volume-sets`, applications are re-associated with volumes regardless of where they are respawned. Because the association between a container and volume is done
*after* the scheduler picks a node, the volume  chosen is a volume that has data local to the node, thus enabling compute-convergent (data colocated with the container) architectures.

## Implementation
When a `volume-set` is requested to be attached, an attempt is made to attach a volume that has data local to the node. If such a volume is not found, then one is
created using the volume spec of the scaled volume as a template.  An error is returned if a free volume in the set is not found and no more volumes can be created as per the `volume-set` `scale` limit.

>**Important:**<br/>You **must** use DCOS constraints when using PX volume sets:
>```json
>"constraints": [["hostname", "UNIQUE"]]
>```
>Failing to do so may cause inconsistent results in the event that Marathon relaunches or reschedules an application upon failure, with the possibility of multiple instances landing on the same host.

## Usage
A `volume-set` can be created using the pxctl CLI, docker CLI, or inline volume spec.  This can be done via the `pxctl` cli, or docker directly as follows:

## pxctl CLI
The `--scale` parameter automatically creates a volume set:

```
# pxctl volume create elk_vol --scale 10
Volume successfully created: 232783593254518125

# pxctl volume list
ID                      NAME            SIZE         HA      SHARED  ENCRYPTED       IO_PRIORITY     SCALE   STATUS
232783593254518125      elk_vol         1 GiB        1       no      no              LOW             10      up - detached
```

## Docker CLI

```
# docker volume create --driver pxd --name elk_vol --opt scale=10
# pxctl volume list
ID                      NAME            SIZE         HA      SHARED  ENCRYPTED       IO_PRIORITY     SCALE   STATUS
232783593254518125      elk_vol         1 GiB        1       no      no              LOW             10      up - detached
```

## Inline `volume-set` creation through DCOS
This is useful when creating volumes through DCOS.

```
# docker volume create -d pxd --name scale=10,size=1G,repl=1,name=elk_vol

# pxctl volume list
ID                      NAME            SIZE         HA      SHARED  ENCRYPTED       IO_PRIORITY     SCALE   STATUS
232783593254518125      elk_vol         1 GiB        1       no      no              LOW             10      up - detached
```

### Update scale factor after volume creation

A `volume-set`'s scale factor can be modified after the volume is created:

```
# pxctl volume update scale_vol --scale 12
# pxctl volume list
ID                      NAME            SIZE         HA      SHARED  ENCRYPTED       IO_PRIORITY     SCALE   STATUS
232783593254518125      elk_vol         1 GiB        1       no      no              LOW             12      up - detached
```

Decreasing the scaled volume only restricts creation of future volumes. Decreasing scale will not delete any volumes.

### Examples
Following is an example that takes advantage of `volume-sets`

            "value": "name=minio_cfg,size=2,repl=3,scale=3:/root/.minio"
           }
         ],

            }

        }
   ]
}
```


## FAQ

### Can I attach more than one instance of a `volume-set` on the same node?
If multiple containers request the same volume from a `volume-set` on a node, only one instance is created. The volume will be shared between client containers.  This is done to ensure cross application shared-data integrity.

### How do I delete a scaled volume
At present all the instances of the `volume-set` need to be deleted one by one.

### How do I request for a specific instance of a scaled volume
You can always specify a an instance of a `volume-set` by name.
