You will have to run the following steps after destroying a service to clean up all the resources in DCOS.  We are going to clean up the cassandra-px
service in this example. These steps can be used to clean up any service in DCOS includuing the Portworx service.

## 1. Shutdown the service if it is still running

Run `dcos service --inactive` to find the ID of the service that you want to cleanup. The service should in inactive state,
ie ACTIVE should be set to False.

```
$ dcos service --inactive
NAME                     HOST            ACTIVE  TASKS  CPU    MEM      DISK   ID                                         
cassandra-px  ip-10-0-2-15.ec2.internal   False     2    6.7  27530.0  59890.0  cc3a8927-1aec-4a8a-90d6-a9c317f9e8c6-0051  
marathon              10.0.4.203          True     4    3.1   3200.0    0.0    cc3a8927-1aec-4a8a-90d6-a9c317f9e8c6-0001  
metronome             10.0.4.203          True     0    0.0    0.0      0.0    cc3a8927-1aec-4a8a-90d6-a9c317f9e8c6-0000  
portworx      ip-10-0-2-15.ec2.internal   True     6    1.8   5632.0  16384.0  cc3a8927-1aec-4a8a-90d6-a9c317f9e8c6-0050 
```

Then use the `dcos service shutdown` command to shutdown the service

```
$ dcos service shutdown cc3a8927-1aec-4a8a-90d6-a9c317f9e8c6-0051
```

## 2. Run the janitor script to clean up the reserved resources as well as any state stored in Zookeeper
```
$ SERVICE_NAME=cassandra-px
$ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader "docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r ${SERVICE_NAME}-role -p ${SERVICE_NAME}-principal -z dcos-service-${SERVICE_NAME}"
```

## 3. Cleanup PX remnants from slave nodes

If there was a failed PX deployment, then there may be a `/etc/pwx` directory on each of the slave nodes.
<br> If so, this directory should be removed with `rm -rf /etc/pwx`
