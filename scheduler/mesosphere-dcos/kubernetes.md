>**Note:**<br/> Kubernetes on DC/OS with Portworx is only supported from PX version 1.4 onwards

Please make sure you have installed [Portworx on DCOS](/scheduler/mesosphere-dcos/install.html) before proceeding further.

The latest framework starts Portworx with scheduler set to mesos (`-x mesos` option) to
allow Portworx to mount volumes for Kubernetes pods. If you are using an older
version of the framework please update `/etc/pwx/config.json` to set `scheduler`
to `mesos`.

## Install dependencies

When using Kubernetes on DC/OS you will be able to use Portworx from your DC/OS
cluster. You only need to create a Kubernetes Service and proxy pods for Portworx to allow the
in-tree Kubernetes volume plugin to dynamically create and use Portworx volumes. This will also install [Stork](/scheduler/kubernetes/stork.html).

You can create the Service by running the following command:
```
$ version=$(kubectl version --short | awk -Fv '/Server Version: / {print $3}')
$ kubectl apply -f "https://install.portworx.com/?kbver=${version}&dcos=true&stork=true"
```

## Provisioning volumes

After the above spec has been applied, you can create volumes and snapshots
using Kuberenetes.
Please use the following guides:

* [Dynamic Provisioning](/scheduler/kubernetes/dynamic-provisioning.html)
* [Using Pre-provisioned volumes](/scheduler/kubernetes/preprovisioned-volumes.html)
* [Creating and using snapshots](/scheduler/kubernetes/snaps.html)
* [Volume encryption](/scheduler/kubernetes/storage-class-encryption.html)
