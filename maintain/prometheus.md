PX storage and network stats can easily be integrated with [**prometheus**](https://prometheus.io) or similar applications.
These stats are exported at port 9001; your application can poll http://&lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;:9001/metrics to get their runtime values.

## Integration with Prometheus

### Step 1: Configuring Prometheus to watch px node
Add your px node as a target in Prometheus config file:

![Prometheus Config File](/images/prometheus-config.png "Prometheus Config File"){:width="1702px" height="970px"}

In the example above, our node has IP address of 54.173.138.1, so Prometheus is watching 54.173.138.1:9001 as its target. This can be any node in the PX cluster.

### Step 2: PX metrics to watch and building graphs with Prometheus

Once Prometheus starts watching px node, you will be able to see new portworx related metrics added to Prometheus.

You can now build graphs:

**Note**

A curl request on port 9001 also shows the stats:

## Storage and Network stats

### Cluster stats:

```
px_cluster_cpu_percent: average CPU usage for the PX cluster nodes in percentage 
px_cluster_disk_available_bytes: available storage in px cluster in bytes
px_cluster_disk_utilized_bytes: used storage in px cluster in bytes
px_cluster_memory_utilized_percent: average memory usage for the px cluster nodes
px_cluster_pendingio: total bytes (read/write) being currently processed
px_cluster_status_cluster_size: total cluster size
px_cluster_status_nodes_offline: total offline nodes 
px_cluster_status_nodes_online: total online nodes 
px_cluster_status_nodes_storage_down: total storage down nodes 
px_cluster_status_nodes_offline: total offline nodes
px_cluster_status_nodes_online: total online nodes 
px_cluster_status_cluster_quorum: cluster_quorum, 1 = in quorum, 0 = not in quorum
```

### Node stats

```
px_network_io_bytessent: bytes sent by this node to other nodes
px_network_io_received_bytes: bytes received by this node from other nodes
px_node_status_<node_id>_status: <node_id> status, 1 = online, 0 = offline
```

### Volume stats

```
px_volume_capacity_bytes: volume size
px_volume_depth_io: number of i/o operations being served at once
px_volume_halevel: volume HA level
px_volume_iops: operations per second
px_volume_latency_seconds: time spent by
px_volume_read_bytes: total bytes read from volume
px_volume_reads: number of read operations served by the volume
px_volume_readthroughput: bytes read per second
px_volume_writes: number of write operations served by the volume
px_volume_writethroughput: bytes written per second
px_volume_written_bytes: total bytes written to the volume 
```

### Disk stats: collected from /proc/diskstats

```
px_disk_stats_interval_seconds: interval seconds
px_disk_stats_io_seconds: time spent doing I/Os 
px_disk_stats_progress_io: I/Os currently in progress
px_disk_stats_read_bytes: read bytes
px_disk_stats_read_seconds: time spent reading 
px_disk_stats_reads: reads
px_disk_stats_used_bytes: used bytes
px_disk_stats_write_bytes: write bytes
px_disk_stats_write_seconds: write seconds
px_disk_stats_writes: writes
```
