## Portworx Alerts

PX provides a way to monitor your cluster using alerts. It has a predefined set of alerts which are listed below. The alerts are broadly classified into the following types based on the Resource on which it is raised

1. Cluster
2. Nodes
3. Disks
4. Volumes

Each alert has a severity from one of the following levels:

1. INFO
2. WARNING
3. ALARM

### List of Alerts

**Alert Codes**|**Alert Type**|**Severity**|**Resource Type**|**Description**
:-----|:-----|:-----:|:-----:|:-----|
0|DriveOperationFailure|ALARM|DRIVE|Triggered when a driver operations such as add or replace fails.
1|DriveOperationSuccess|NOTIFY|DRIVE|Triggered when a driver operations such as add or replace fails.
2|DriveStateChange|WARN|DRIVE|Triggered when there is a change in the driver state viz. Free Disk space goes below the recommended level of 10%.
3|VolumeOperationFailureAlarm|ALARM|VOLUME|Triggered when a volume operation fails. Volume operations could be resize, cloudsnap etc. The alert message will give more info about the specific error case. 
4|VolumeOperationSuccess|NOTIFY|VOLUME|Triggered when a volume operation such as resize succeeds. 
5|VolumeStateChange|WARN|VOLUME|Triggered when there is a change in the state of the volume.
