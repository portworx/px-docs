### Initial Software Setup for Production

* Deployment - Follow all instructions to deploy Portworx correctly in the scheduler of choice - Refer to the install instructions [page](https://docs.portworx.com/#install-with-a-container-orchestrator)
  * Ensure PX container is deployed as [OCI container](https://docs.portworx.com/runc/)
  * All nodes in the cluster should have achieved quorum and `pxctl status` should display the cluster as `operational`
  * etcd - Ensure etcd is properly configured and setup. Setup etcd as a 3-node etcd cluster outside the container orchestrator to ensure maximum stability. Refer to the following [page](https://docs.portworx.com/maintain/etcd.html) on how to install etcd and also configure it for maximum stability.

### Configuring the Server or the Compute Infrastructure

* Ensure that at the minimum 4 cores and 4GB of RAM are allocated for Portworx
* Ensure the base operating system of the server supports linux kernel 3.10+
* Ensure the shared mount propagation is enabled

### Configuring the Networking Infrastructure

* Ensure all the required ports are open as defined in the PX-Enterprise requirements
* Configure separate networks for Data and Management networks to isolate the traffic


### Configuring and Provisioning Underlying Storage

* Disks - If this is a on-prem installation, ensure there is enough storage available per node for PX storage pools.
  If it is a cloud deployment, ensure you have enough cloud disks attached. 
  
  * For AWS ASG, Portworx supports automatic management of EBS volumes. 
    It is recommended to use the ASG [feature](https://docs.portworx.com/cloud/aws/asg.html)

* HW RAID - If there are a large number of drives in a server and drive failure tolerance is required per server, enable HW RAID (if available) and give the block device from a HW RAID volume for Portworx to manage. 

### Volume Management Best Practices

* Volumes - Portworx volumes are thinly provisioned by default. Make sure to monitor for capacity threshold alerts. Refer to the alerts page for more information

### Data Protection for Containers

* Snapshots - Follow DR best practices and ensure volume snapshots are scheduled for instantaneous recovery in the case of app failures. Visit the [DR best practices](dr-best-practices.html) page for more information.

* Cloudsnaps - Follow DR best practices and setup a periodic cloudsnaps so in case of a disaster, Portworx volumes can be restored from an offsite backup

### Alerts and Monitoring for Production

  * Here is how Prometheus can be setup to monitor Portworx [Prometheus] (monitoring/prometheus/index.html)
  * Configure Grafana via this [template](monitoring/grafana/index.html)
  * Here is how Alerts Manager can be configured for looking for alerts with [Alerts Manager](monitoring/alerting.html)
  * List of Portworx Alerts are documented [here](monitoring/portworx-alerts.html)

### Hardware Replacements and Upgrades

#### Server Upgrades and Replacements

#### Disk Upgrades and Replacements

#### Networking Upgrades and Replacements

### Software Upgrades

* Portworx Software Upgrades - Work with Portworx Support before planning major upgrades. Ensure all volumes have the 
  latest snapshot and cloudsnap before performing upgrades

* Container Orchestrator upgrades - Ensure all volumes are cloud-snapped before performing scheduler upgrades

* OS upgrades - Ensure all volumes have a snapshot before performing underlying OS upgrades. 
  Ensure kernel-devel packages are installed after a OS migration
