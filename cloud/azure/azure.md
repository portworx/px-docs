This guide shows you how you can easily deploy Portworx on [**Azure**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

### Step 1: Provision Virtual Machine
When chosing an instance, verify that you meet the [minimum requirements](/getting-started/px-enterprise.html#step-1-verify-requirements)

Portworx recommends a minimum cluster size of 3 nodes.

### Step 2: Attach Data Disk to Azure VM
Follow the instuctions from Azure documentation [How to attach a data disk to a Linux VM in the Azure portal
](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-attach-disk-portal/)

Your deployment will look something like following:

### Step 3: Install Docker for the appropriate OS Version 
Portworx recommends Docker 1.12 with [Device Mapper](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/#/configure-docker-with-devicemapper).

Note: Portworx requires Docker to allow shared mounts.  This is standard as of Docker 1.12.  
If you are running Docker without shared mounts, please follow the steps listed [here](/knowledgebase/shared-mount-propogation.html)

### Step 4: Launch PX-Enterprise
[Follow the instructions to launch PX-Enterprise](/getting-started/px-enterprise.html)

Use the docker run command to launch PX-Enterprise, substituting the appropriate multipath devices and network interfaces, as identified from the previous steps.

Alternatively, you can either run the 'px_bootstrap' script from curl, or construct your own [config.json](/control/config-json.html) file.

From the server node running px-enterprise container, you should see the following status:

You should also be able to monitor cluster from PX-Enterprise console:
