This guide shows you how you can easily deploy Portworx on the [**digitalocean.com** cloud platform](http://digitalocean.com)
using [Terraform](http://terraform.io) infrastructure automation.

Following these simple instructions you can have a 3-node Portworx cluster up and running in under 5 minutes.

Other supported bare metal cloud providers are

* [Packet.net](/cloud/packet.html)
* [Rackspace](/cloud/rackspace.html)

Pre-requisites:   You will need to have a valid Digital Ocean account

### Step 1: Install Terraform

Download, unzip and install Terraform for your particular OS distro from the main [Terraform Download site](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Step 2: Clone the Terraporx Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/portworx/terraporx.git
cd terraporx/digital_ocean
```

### Step 3: Select your OS Distro
This Digital Ocean repository currently supports 3 different Linux OS flavors: 

* CoreOS
* Ubuntu16
* CentOS7

Select and `cd` into the OS distro of your choice.

The scripts for Ubuntu and CentOS will both install the current version 
of **'docker-ce'** and launch a single **'etcd'** container for the Portworx required 'kvdb'.

CoreOS will configure **user_data** to launch the internal **'etcd2'** service and also launch **'px-dev'** as a 'systemd' service.

### Step 4: Configure your Terraform variables

The following variable definitions are required in the `vars.tf` file in the corresponding OS directory:

* 'do_token'  : Your Digital Ocean API key.  Obtain or generate your token from here [https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)
* 'region'    : These scripts require block storage, which is only available in these regions **fra1, nyc1, sfo2 and sgp1**
* 'size'      : These are the valid instance sizes (strings) : **"2gb", "4gb", "8gb", "16gb", "32gb", "48gb", "64gb"**
* 'volsize'   : These are the valid external volume sizes (integer in GB):  **100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000**
* 'prefix'    : An arbitrary distinguishing name for your cluster prefix
* 'ssh_key_path'  :  The path to your private SSH key
* 'pub_key'       :  The contents of your public SSH key
* 'ssh_fingerprint' :  The fingerprint of your SSH key, best obtained via `ssh-keygen -E md5  -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

In addition for CoreOS, you will need to supply a *'discovery_url'* for the 'etcd' service,
which can be best obtained from the output of `curl http://discovery.etcd.io/new?size=3`

Make sure the SSH key variables correspond to a valid SSH key in your Digital Ocean profile
in the Security settings for your account [https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/security](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/security)

### Step 5: Create your cluster

Run `terraform apply` .
If all variables have been properly specified then after a few minutes, the following output will appear:

```
Outputs:

ip-addrs = [
    ssh core@138.197.219.111,
    ssh core@138.68.225.115,
    ssh core@138.68.248.179
]
```

You can then login to validate the cluster state:

```
ssh core@138.197.219.111
The authenticity of host '138.197.219.111 (138.197.219.111)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 0e:9f:26:88:2a:3b:66:3d:08:11:b7:70:84:df:92:1f.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

### Step 6: (optional)  Tear down your cluster

To teardown the cluster, use `terraform destroy` or `terraform destroy --force`
