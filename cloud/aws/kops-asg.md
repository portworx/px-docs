This is a guide to setup a production ready Portworx cluster using Kubernetes (KOPS+AWS) environment that allows you to dynamically provision persistent volumes. KOPS helps you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes clusters. Under the hood KOPS uses AWS Autoscaling groups (ASG) to spin up EC2 instances.

## Portworx in an Auto Scaling Group

## Prerequisites

**KOPS cluster in AWS**

Detailed instructions on how to setup a KOPS cluster in AWS are documented [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/KOPS/blob/master/docs/aws.md).

## AWS Requirements

{% include asg/aws-prereqs.md %}

## EBS volume template

{% include asg/ebs-template.md %}

## Install

Portworx gets deployed as a [Kubernetes DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). Following sections describe how to generate the spec files and apply them.

### Generate the Portworx Spec

When generating the spec, following parameters are important for KOPS:
1. __AWS environment variables__: In the environment variables option (_e_), specify _AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID_ and _AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY_ for the KOPS IAM user. Example: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\<id>,AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\<key>. If you are using instance privileges you can ignore setting the environment variables.

2. __Volume template__: In the drives option (_s_), specific the EBS volume template that you created in previous step. Portworx will dynamically create EBS volumes based on this template.

{% include k8s-spec-generate.md %}

### Apply the spec

Once you have generated the spec file, deploy Portworx.
```bash
kubect apply -f px-spec.yaml
```

{% include k8s-monitor-install.md %}

## Deploy a sample application

Now that you have Portworx installed, checkout various examples of [applications using Portworx on Kubernetes](/scheduler/kubernetes/k8s-px-app-samples.html).
