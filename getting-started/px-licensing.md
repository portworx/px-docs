## Introduction

Starting with the v1.2.8 release, the Portworx products support the following license types:

|      License type      |  Description
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| PX-Developer           | Embedded into [px-developer](/developer/index.html), free license that supports limited functionality.
| Trial                  | Automatically installed w/ [px-enterprise](/index.html#install), enables full functionality for 30 days.
| PX-Enterprise VM Basic | Commercial license, suitable for medium-sized VM/cloud based installs (see [Features](https://portworx.com/products/features/))
| PX-Enterprise VM Plus  | Enterprise license, suitable for large VM/cloud -based installs (see [Features](https://portworx.com/products/features/))
| PX-Enterprise Metal    | Enterprise license, suitable for large installs on any hardware (see [Features](https://portworx.com/products/features/))


Depending on the type of the container you are installing, a different license will be automatically activated:

* [px-developer](/developer/index.html) container activates free "PX-Developer" license, and
* [px-enterprise](/index.html#install) automatically
activates the "Trial" license (limited to 30 days), which can be upgraded to one of the "PX-Enterprise" licenses at any time.


## Checking your License

A brief license summary is provided with the `pxctl status` command:

```

## Type of Licenses

### PX-Developer License

The "PX-Developer" license is a default license for [px-developer](/developer/index.html) containers.
The "PX-Developer" license is permanent and free, and provides a limited set of functionality, with unrestricted use.
It supports the following features:

```

```


### Trial License

The "Trial" license activates automatically when the [px-enterprise](/index.html#install) container is installed.
The trial license provides the full product functionality for 30 days.

```
DESCRIPTION                  ENABLEMENT  ADDITIONAL INFO

**EXPIRATION**:

When the trial period expires, one will no longer be able to create new volumes or volume snapshots.
The normal functionality may be restored at any time, by purchasing and installing the "PX-Enterprise" license.

**UPGRADE NOTES**:

* The "Trial" license can be upgraded into a "PX-Enterprise" license by contacting
support@portworx.com, and activating via the "activation code" or via the
license file (see [PX-Enterprise](#px-enterprise-license) below for details)
* The "Trial" license itself cannot be upgraded or extended with another "Trial", or downgraded into "PX-Developer" license.


### PX-Enterprise License

The "PX-Enterprise" license is our most flexible license, which comes with a number of options.
Please refer to [Features page](https://portworx.com/products/features/) to
determine which type of "PX-Enterprise" license will work best for your needs.

**LICENSE SHARING**:

Once installed, the PX-Enterprise license is "locked" to a single PX-Cluster via the unique UUID identifier of the cluster.
Such license (or, license-file) will not work on other clusters.


**INSTALLATION**:

The easiest way to install the "PX-Enterprise" license, is via the
 "Activation ID" (reach out to us at support@portworx.com for purchasing licenses), ie:

```
# pxctl license activate c0ffe-fefe-activation-123
```

Note that the "license activation" process will require active Internet connection from the PX-nodes to the license-server,
as the activation process automatically registers the cluster UUID, generates and installs the license on the cluster.
Upon activating the license on one PX-node, all remaining PX-nodes will automatically update to the new license.



**INSTALL ON AIR-GAPPED ENVIRONMENTS**: Customers that do not have an active Internet connection on their PX-cloud, will need to be guided by the Portworx support (can be reached at support@portworx.com) , and will follow a slightly different process.

Customers will be asked to provide the `Cluster UUID` information (available via `pxctl cluster list` command):

```
# pxctl cluster list
Cluster ID: MY_FAVORITE_PX_CLUSTER
Cluster UUID: f987ad4b-987c-4e7e-a8bd-788c89cc40f1
Status: OK [...]
```

Upon supplying the "Cluster UUID", the customers will get their "license file".
The "license file" will need to be uploaded to one of the PX-nodes, and activated via the following command:

```
# pxctl license add license_file.bin
```

Finally, please note that the license installation is a non-obtrusive process, which will not interfere with the data stored
on the PX volumes, nor will it interrupt the active IO operations.
