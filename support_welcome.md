# Welcome to Portworx Support

Thank you for being a valued Portworx customer.   
At Portworx we are committed to your success and to offering you the best possible customer experience.

At Portworx, customer responsiveness is our highest priority.
We offer a number of ways for you to connect directly with our Engineers, Architects and Support Team.

## Slack
We offer private slack channels, per company/site.   Slack channels offer the most immediate way to
interact with the Portworx Team.    All interaction on the private slack channels are strictly between
Portworx and the customer company/site.

To obtain a private slack channel, please send the name of your company/site and the
email addresses of your team to "support@portworx.com".   You will be notified by email on how to activate.

## Portworx Support Portal (PSP)
We have a Portworx Support Portal (PSP) that is maintained through Atlassian/Jira.
Using the PSP offers a way to open support cases to report product defects
or product feature requests.

For customers that do not enable Slack access through their corporate firewall, please use PSP
as the primary support mechanism.

To obtain access to the PSP, please send the name of your company/site and the
email addresses of your team to "support@portworx.com".   You will be notified by email on how to activate.

## Support Email Alias
We can also maintain support through a general purpose support email alias : "support@portworx.com".
<br>Access to the support email alias is open, unfiltered and unmoderated.

## Phone Support
We also offer Phone Support by calling our Support Hotline at +1 (650) 397-8535
<br>Phone Support is available on a 24x7 basis

Please do not hesitate to engage with us for any problems, issues, questions or requests you may have.
<br>Again, your customer experience is our highest priority.   

Thank you for choosing Portworx.
