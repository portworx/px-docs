You can use Portworx to provide docker volumes for Mesos and Mesosphere through Marathon. Portworx pools your servers' capacity and is deployed as a container. Mesosphere has been qualified using DC/OS 1.7.   Mesos has been qualified using Mesos 1.0.1.   Marathon has been qualified, using version 1.3.6.

The Marathon service maps options through the Docker command line to reference the Portworx volume driver and associated volume.

Here is a short video that shows how to configure and run Portworx with Mesosphere:
{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}


## Step 1: Install Mesosphere DC/OS CLI or Apache Mesos

For Mesosphere, follow the instructions for installing [Mesosphere DC/OS](https://dcos.io/install) and the [DC/OS CLI](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.7/usage/cli/install).
Use the DC/OS CLI command `dcos node` to identify which nodes in the Mesos cluster are the Agent nodes.

If not using Mesosphere, then follow the instructions appropriate for your OS distribution and environment to install both Apache Mesos and Marathon. 

## Step 2: Add Mesos constraints to Mesos-slave Nodes (optional)

If the size of your Mesos cluster is larger than the maximum number of nodes supported for a Portworx release,
then you will need to use Mesos "constraints", in order to restrict/constrain jobs that use Portworx volumes to only run
on Mesos-slave nodes where Portworx is running.   (Please check the Portworx release notes for maximum Portworx cluster size).
Otherwise, Portworx recommends simply deploying Portworx on all nodes in a Mesos cluster, thereby avoiding the need to use "constraints".

The following steps are required only for configuring and using "constraints".

For each Mesosphere Agent node or Mesos-slave that is participating in the PX cluster, specify Mesos attributes that allow for affinity of tasks to nodes that are part of the Portworx cluster.

If using Mesosphere/DCOS:

```
  echo MESOS_ATTRIBUTES=pxfabric:pxclust1 >> /var/lib/dcos/mesos-slave-common
  rm -f /var/lib/mesos/slave/meta/slaves/latest
  systemctl restart dcos-mesos-slave.service
  systemctl status dcos-mesos-slave.service -l
```

If using Apache Mesos:

```
   mkdir -p /etc/default/mesos-slave/attributes
   echo pxclust1 > /etc/default/mesos-slave/attributes/pxfabric
   rm -f /var/lib/mesos/slave/meta/slaves/latest
   systemctl restart mesos-slave
   systemctl status mesos-slave -l
```

## Step 3: Deploy Portworx

### Step 3a: Deploy Portworx through Universe
Portworx is now available through the Mesosphere Universe catalog of services.

Deploying Portworx through Mesosphere Universe provides great ease of deployment.
Please follow the published [Mesosphere/DCOS Examples for deploying Portworx through Universe](https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/1.8/portworx) 


### Step 3b: Deploy Portworx through Marathon

This section assumes that Portworx will be installed on a set of homogeneously configured machines (which is not a general requirement for Portworx).
The pre-requisites for installing Portworx through Marathon include:

1. Determine the list of physical devices (disks and interfaces) for the agent/slave nodes
2. If running PX-Enterprise in '**air-gapped**' mode, then follow instructions for [running a standalone etcd](/run-etcd.html) and note the IPaddress and Port. 
3. If running PX-Enterprise, obtain your Lighthouse token.

The following is a sample JSON file that can be used to launch Portworx through Marathon

>**Important:**<br/> If you are deploying Portworx on all nodes in the cluster, then you should omit the *"pxfabric"* constraint.

```

    ],

            }],
            "privileged": true,
            "parameters": [{
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/run/docker/plugins:/run/docker/plugins"
            }, {
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/var/lib/osd:/var/lib/osd:shared"
            }, {
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/dev:/dev"
            }, {
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/etc/pwx:/etc/pwx"
            }, {
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/opt/pwx/bin:/export_bin:shared"
            }, {
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
            }, {
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/var/cores:/var/cores"
            }, {
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/lib/modules:/lib/modules"
            }, {
                "key": "volume",
                "value": "/usr/src:/usr/src"
            } ],
            "forcePullImage": false
        }
    },
    "portDefinitions": [],
    "ipAddress": {},
    "args": [
        "--name pxcluster.mesos",
        "--ipc host",
        "-k etcd:http://1.2.3.4:4001",
        "-c mesos-demo1",
        "-s /dev/sdb",
        "-m enp0s3",
        "-d enp0s3"
    ],
    "healthChecks": [
     {
       "protocol": "COMMAND",
       "command": { "value": "curl -X GET http://$HOST:9001/status"},
       "portIndex": 0,
       "gracePeriodSeconds": 300,
       "intervalSeconds": 60,
       "timeoutSeconds": 20,
       "maxConsecutiveFailures": 3,
       "ignoreHttp1xx": false
   }
  ]
}
```

This example illustrates running PX-Enterprise in an "air-gapped" environment, as noted by the "**-c mesos-demo1**" cluster argument and the "**-k etcd**" argument for the key-value database.


If running PX-Enterprise with Lighthouse (SaaS or on-prem), then both the "**-c**" and "**-k**" options would be replaced with a single "**-t**" option indiciating the Lighthouse token-ID.

Each physical device must be listed with its own "**-s**" argument.

In this example a single network interface ("enp0s3") is used for both management and data traffic.

For all command line options, please see [px-enterprise-usage](/px-usage.html)





## Step 4: Reference PX volumes through the Marathon configuration file

Portworx passes the `pxd` docker volume driver and any associated volumes to Marathon as Docker parameters. The following example is for `mysql`.

```
{
    "id": "mysql",
    "cpus": 0.5,
    "mem": 256,
    "instances": 1,
    "container": {
        "type": "DOCKER",
        "docker": {
            "image": "mysql:5.6.27",
            "parameters": [
                    {
                       "key": "volume-driver",
                       "value": "pxd"
                    },
                    {
                       "key": "volume",
                       "value": "mysql_vol:/var/lib/mysql"
                    }],
            "network": "BRIDGE",
              "portMappings": [
                {
                  "containerPort": 3306,
                  "hostPort": 32000,
                  "protocol": "tcp"
                }
                ]
        }
    },
    "constraints": [
            [
              "pxfabric",
              "LIKE",
              "pxclust1"
            ]],
    "env": {
        "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD": "password"
    },
      "minimumHealthCapacity" :0,
      "maximumOverCapacity" : 0.0
}
```

* Notice the Docker `parameters` clause as the way to reference the `pxd` volume driver as well as the volume itself.
* The referenced volume can be a volume name, a volume ID, or a snapshot ID.   If the volume name does not previously exist, it gets created in-band with default settings.
* The `constraints` clause, restricts this task to running only on Agent nodes that are part of a given Portworx cluster.

>**Important:**<br/> If you are deploying Portworx on all nodes in the cluster, then you should omit the *"pxfabric"* constraint.


## Step 5: Launch the application through Marathon

To launch the application through the DC/OS CLI:

```
dcos marathon app add mysql.json
```

To launch the application through Marathon directly:

```
curl -X POST http://1.2.3.4:8080/v2/apps -d @mysql.json -H "Content-type: application/json"
```
