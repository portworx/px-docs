EC2 instances in an ASG are ephemeral in nature. In such an environment Portworx can create EBS volumes based on an input template whenever a new instance spins up and provision persistent volumes for your applications. Portworx fingerprints the EBS volumes and attaches them to an instance in the autoscaling cluster. In this way an ephemeral instance gets its own identity.  When an instance terminates, the auto scaling group will automatically add a new instance to the cluster. Portworx gracefully handle this scenario by re-attaching the old EBS volumes to it and give a new instance the old identity. In this way all the data is retained with zero storage downtime.
