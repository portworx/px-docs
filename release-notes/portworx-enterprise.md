## 1.3.4

***NOTE 1***

Upgrading to this release from any release prior to 1.3.3 requires a node reboot if the node has attached Portworx volumes. To avoid a node reboot, migrate the containers using Portworx to a different node and then perform an upgrade.  For Kubernetes clusters, please refer to the Kubernetes [upgrade process](https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/upgrade.html#upgrading-portworx)
 to manage the automatic rolling upgrade of the cluster.
 
 
This is a minor update with fixes for decomissioning nodes running PX and system options for optimized performance

* PWX-5521 - Add a CLI command to purge alerts
* PWX-5524 - Fix an issue with parsing the node names when decomissioning the nodes
* Provide a way set the vm.dirty_bytes value via startup parameter.

## 1.3.3

***NOTE 1***

Upgrading to this release requires a node reboot if the node has attached Portworx volumes. To avoid a node reboot, migrate the containers using Portworx to a different node and then perform an upgrade.  For Kubernetes clusters, please refer to the Kubernetes [upgrade process](https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/upgrade.html#upgrading-portworx)
 to manage the automatic rolling upgrade of the cluster.
 
***NOTE 2***

From, PX 1.3.3 enforces a maximum number of 512 _attached_ volumes per node. A request to attach more than 512 volumes on a node will return an error.  In the rare event that PX is upgraded from an old version that has more than 512 attached volumes on a node, PX 1.3.3, will enter maintenance mode on upgrade. This node can be brought back by reattaching the volumes in another node and bring the number of attached volumes to the enforced 512 attached volumes per node limit. Please reach out to support@portworx.com or on Portworx Slack for help.

### Key Fixes

* Improve handling of etcd leader restarts in PX
* Handle cases where more than 180 volumes remain attached to a PX node across restarts - Enforce PX support for 512 attached   volumes per node
* Reduce time taken to decomission storageless nodes.


### Errata

* In the case of a three node etcd cluster, if the etcd leader node gets partitioned from the remaining two nodes because of a network link failure but the PX cluster nodes can access all the etcd nodes, the current etcdclient doesn't handle such a network partition case correctly. This is a known issue with etcd and Portworx is following up with the community on this.

## 1.3.2

This is a patch release with bug fixes handling sharedv4 related issues

* PWX-5351 - Reduce the `pxctl volume list` time taken when a large number of volumes are present
* PWX-5443 - Handle sharedv4 server node restarts and reattach PODs consuming such volumes automatically
* PWX-4411 - Show IP address instead of NodeID in volume commands that show the node information

## 1.3.1.4

This is a minor update that improves degraded cluster performance when one or more nodes are down for a long time and brought back online that starts the resync process

## 1.3.1.2

This is a minor update to fix install issues with RHEL Atomic and other fixes.

* RHEL Atomic install fixes
* Clean up any existing diag files before running diags command again
* `pxctl upgrade` fixes to pull the latest image information from install.portworx.com
* Improvements in attached device detection logic in some cloud environments

## 1.3.1.1

This is a minor update to the previous 1.3.1 release

* Fix to make node resync process yield better to application I/O  when some of nodes are down for a longer period of time 
  and brought back up thereby triggering the resync process.

## 1.3.1

This is a patch release with shared volume performance and stability fixes

### Key Fixes:

* Fix namespace client crashes when client list is generated when few client nodes are down.
* Allow read/write snapshots in k8s annotations
* Make adding and removing k8s node labels asynchronous to help with large number volume creations in parallel
* Fix PX crash when a snapshot is taken at the same time as node being marked down because of network failures
* Fix nodes option in docker inline volume create and supply nodes value as semicolon separated values

## 1.3.0.1

This is a patch update with the following fix

* PWX-5115 - Fix `nodes` option in [docker inline volume create](https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/docker/volume-plugin.html#replicaset) and supply nodes value as semicolon separated values

## 1.3.0 

***Upgrade Note 1***: Upgrade to 1.3 requires a node restart in non-k8s environments. In k8s environments, the cluster does a rolling upgrade

***Upgrade Note 2***: Ensure all nodes in PX cluster are running 1.3 version before increasing replication factor for the volumes

***Upgrade Note 3***: Container information parsing code has been disabled and hence the PX-Lighthouse up to 1.1.7 version will not show the container information page. This feature will be back in future releases and with the new lighthouse

### Feature updates and noteworthy changes

* Volume create command additions to include volume clone command and integrate snap commands
* Improved snapshot workflows 
  * Clones - full volume copy created from a snapshot
  * Changes to snapshot CLI.
  * Creating scheduled snapshots policies per volume
  * ***Important*** From 1.3 onwards, all snapshots are readonly. If the user wishes to create a read/write snapshot, a volume    clone can be created from the snapshot

    All the EBS volumes it creates and attaches are listed in kvdb and this information is then used to 
    find out EBS volumes being used by PX nodes
  * Added command `pxctl cloud list` to list all the drives created via ASG
* Integrated kvdb - Early Access - Limited Release for small clusters less than 10 nodes

### New CLI Additions and changes to existing ones

### Errata

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running "pxctl service m --exit", the message "Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel operation or wait for completion" doesn't specify which operation hasn't completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations (add, replace, rebalance). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.

* PWX-4016 When running under Kubernetes, adding a node label for a scheduled cloudsnap fails with the error "Failed to update k8s node". A node label isn't needed for cloudsnaps because they are read-only and used only for backup to the cloud.

* PWX-4021 In case of a failure while a read-only snapshot create operation is in progress, Portworx might fail to come back up. This can happen if the failure coincides with snapshot creation's file system freeze step, which is required to fence incoming IOs during the operation. To recover from this issue, reboot the node.

* PWX-4027 Canceling a service drive replace operation fails with the message "Replace cancel failed - Not in progress". However, if you try to exit maintenance mode, the status message indicates that a maintenance operation is in progress. Workaround: Wait for the drive replace operation to finish. The replace operation might be in a state where it can't be canceled. Cancel operations are performed when possible.

* PWX-4039 When running Ubuntu on Azure, an XFS volume format fails. Do not use XFS volumes when running Ubuntu on Azure.

* PWX-4043 When a Portworx POD gets deleted in Kubernetes, no alerts are generated to indicate the POD deletion via kubectl.

* PWX-4050 For a Portworx cluster that's about 100 nodes or greater: If the entire cluster goes down with all the nodes off line, as nodes come on line a few nodes get restarted because they are marked offline. A short while after, the system converges and the entire cluster becomes operational. No user intervention required.

* Key Management with AWS KMS doesn't work anymore because of API changes on the AWS side. Will be fixed in an upcoming release. Refer to this link for additional details. https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/1043

* When shared volumes are configured with io_profile=cms, it results in the px-ns process restarting occasionally.

## 1.2.23.0

This is a minor update that fixes an panic seen in some k8s environments when the user upgraded from a older version of PX to 1.2.22

PWX-5107 - Check if node spec is present before adding the node for volume state change events

## 1.2.22.0

* Support SELinux enable in kernels 4.12.x and above
* Support automatic kernel upgrades. If you expect your environment to upgrade kernels automatically, Portworx recommends to uprade to 1.2.22.0

## 1.2.20.0

* Minor update to enhance write performance for remote moounts with shared volumes
* 4.15.3 Linux kernel support

### Errata (Errata remains the same from 1.2.11.0 release)

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running "pxctl service m --exit", the message "Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel operation or wait for completion" doesn't specify which operation hasn't completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations (add, replace, rebalance). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.
* PWX-4014 The pxctl cloudsnap schedule command creates multiple backups for the scheduled time. This issue has no functional impact and will be resolved in the upcoming release.
* PWX-4016 When running under Kubernetes, adding a node label for a scheduled cloudsnap fails with the error "Failed to update k8s node". A node label isn't needed for cloudsnaps because they are read-only and used only for backup to the cloud.
* PWX-4017 An incremental cloudsnap backup command fails with the message "Failed to open snap for backup". Logs indicates that the backup wasn't found on at least on one of the nodes where the volume was provisioned. Workaround: Trigger another backup manually on the nodes that failed.
* PWX-4021 In case of a failure while a read-only snapshot create operation is in progress, Portworx might fail to come back up. This can happen if the failure coincides with snapshot creation's file system freeze step, which is required to fence incoming IOs during the operation. To recover from this issue, reboot the node.

* PWX-4721 - When cloud-snap is performed on large number of volumes, it results in a PX container restart. Workaround is to run cloudsnaps on up to 10 volumes concurrently.

## 1.2.18.0

### Fixed issues

* Improve file import and untar performance when shared volumes are used by Wordpress and tune for wordpress plugin behavior

### Errata (Errata remains the same from 1.2.11.0 release)

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running "pxctl service m --exit", the message "Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel operation or wait for completion" doesn't specify which operation hasn't completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations (add, replace, rebalance). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.
* PWX-4014 The pxctl cloudsnap schedule command creates multiple backups for the scheduled time. This issue has no functional impact and will be resolved in the upcoming release.

* Shared volume access latency improvements when managing filesystems with large number of directories and files

### Errata (Errata remains the same from 1.2.11.0 release)

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running "pxctl service m --exit", the message "Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel operation or wait for completion" doesn't specify which operation hasn't completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations (add, replace, rebalance). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.
* PWX-4014 The pxctl cloudsnap schedule command creates multiple backups for the scheduled time. This issue has no functional impact and will be resolved in the upcoming release.
* PWX-4016 When running under Kubernetes, adding a node label for a scheduled cloudsnap fails with the error "Failed to update k8s node". A node label isn't needed for cloudsnaps because they are read-only and used only for backup to the cloud.
* PWX-4017 An incremental cloudsnap backup command fails with the message "Failed to open snap for backup". Logs indicates that the backup wasn't found on at least on one of the nodes where the volume was provisioned. Workaround: Trigger another backup manually on the nodes that failed.
* PWX-4021 In case of a failure while a read-only snapshot create operation is in progress, Portworx might fail to come back up. This can happen if the failure coincides with snapshot creation's file system freeze step, which is required to fence incoming IOs during the operation. To recover from this issue, reboot the node.
* PWX-4027 Canceling a service drive replace operation fails with the message "Replace cancel failed - Not in progress". However, if you try to exit maintenance mode, the status message indicates that a maintenance operation is in progress. Workaround: Wait for the drive replace operation to finish. The replace operation might be in a state where it can't be canceled. Cancel operations are performed when possible.
* PWX-4039 When running Ubuntu on Azure, an XFS volume format fails. Do not use XFS volumes when running Ubuntu on Azure.
* PWX-4043 When a Portworx POD gets deleted in Kubernetes, no alerts are generated to indicate the POD deletion via kubectl.
* PWX-4050 For a Portworx cluster that's about 100 nodes or greater: If the entire cluster goes down with all the nodes off line, as nodes come on line a few nodes get restarted because they are marked offline. A short while after, the system converges and the entire cluster becomes operational. No user intervention required.

## 1.2.14.0
This is a minor update to support the older linux kernel versions (4.4.0.x) that ships with Ubuntu distributions

## 1.2.12.1
This is a minor update to support Openshift with SELinux enabled as well as verify with SPECTRE/Meltdown kernel patches

* Verified with the latest kernel patches for SPECTRE/Meltdown issue for all major Linux distros

## 1.2.12.0
This is a minor update to enhance meta data performance on a shared namespace volume.

### Fixed issues
* Readdir performance for directories with a large number of files (greater 128K file count in a single directory)
* PX running on AWS AutoScalingGroup now handles existing devices attached with names such as `/dev/xvdcw` which have an extra letter at the end.
* Occasionally, containers that use shared volumes could get a "transport end point disconnected" error when PX restarts.  This has been resolved.
* Fixed an issue where Portworx failed to resolve Kubernetes services by their DNS names if user sets the Portworx DaemonSet DNS Policy as `ClusterFirstWithHostNet`.
* PWX- 4078 When PX runs in 100s of nodes, a few nodes show high memory usage. 



## 1.2.11.10
This is a minor update to address an issue with installing a reboot service while upgrading a runC container.

### Fixed issues
* When upgrading a runC container, the new version will correctly install a reboot service.  A reboot service (systemd service) is needed to reduce the wait time before a PX device returns with a timeout when the PX service is down.  Without this reboot service, a node can take 10 minutes to reboot.

## 1.2.11.9

### Fixed issues

* Pass volume name as part of the metrics end point so Prometheus/Grafana can display with volume name
* Add current ha level of the volume and io_priority of the volumes to the metrics endpoint
* Abort all pending I/Os the the pxd device during a reboot so speed up reboots
* Move the px-ns internal port from 7000 to 9013
* Remove the unnecessary warning string "Data is not local to the node"
* Add px_ prefix to all volume labels

### Errata 

* Do not manually unmount a volume by using linux `umount` command for shared volume mounts. This errata applies to the previous versions of PX as well.

## 1.2.11.8

### Fixed issues

* Fix resync mechanism for read-only snapshots
* Improve log space utilization by removing old log files based on space usage

### Errata 

* Do not manually unmount a volume by using linux `umount` command for shared volume mounts. This errata applies to the previous versions of PX as well.

## 1.2.11.7

### Fixed issues

* Suppress un-necessary log prints about cache flush
* PWX-4272 Handle remote host shutdowns gracefully for shared volumes. In the past this could leave stray TCP connections.

### Errata 

* Do not manually unmount a volume by using linux `umount` command for shared volume mounts. This errata applies to the previous versions of PX as well.

## 1.2.11.6 Release notes

### Fixed issues

* Provide capability to drop system cache on-demand (for a select workloads and large memory system) and turn it off by default

## 1.2.11.5 Release notes

### Key Features and Changes

* PWX-4178 Perform snapshots in kubernetes via [annotations](https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/snaps.html#using-annotations)

## 1.2.11.4 Release notes

### Key Features and Changes

* PX-Enterprise container is now available in [OCI Format](https://docs.portworx.com/runc/)
* Enhancements for db workloads to handle slow media

### Fixed issues

* PWX-4224 Ignore `sticky` flag when purging old snapshots after a cloudsnap is completed.
* PWX-4220 `pxctl status` shows the first interface IP address instead of the mgmt. IP

## 1.2.11.3 Release notes

### Fixed Issues

* Shared volume performance improvements
* Do not take a a inline snap in k8s when no valid candidate pvcs are found

## 1.2.11.2 Release notes

### Fixed Issues

* Increase file descriptors to support large number of shared volumes

## 1.2.11.1 Release notes

### Fixed Issues

* Fix file descriptors not being released after reporting containers attached to a shared volume

## 1.2.11.0 Release notes

### Key Features and Changes
* You can now update volume labels. The pxctl volume update command has a new option, --label pairs. Specify a list of comma-separated name=value pairs. For example, if the current labels are x1=v1,x2=v2:

   The option "--labels x1=v4" results in the labels x1=v4,x2=v2.

   The option "--labels x1=" results in the labels x2=v2 (removes a label).

* Improvements to alerts:
   - Additional alerts indicate the cluster status in much more finer detail. This document has more details on all the alerts posted by PX: [https://docs.portworx.com/maintain/monitoring/portworx-alerts.html](https://docs.portworx.com/maintain/monitoring/portworx-alerts.html)
   - Rate limiting for alerts so that an alert isn't repeatedly posted within a short timeframe.

* You can now update the io_profile field by using the `pxctl volume update` command so the parameter can be enabled for existing volumes. 

### Fixed Issues
* PWX-3146 Portworx module dependencies fail to load for openSUSE Leap 42.2, Kernel 4.4.57-18.3-default.
* PWX-3362 If a node is in maintenance mode because of disk errors, the node isn't switched to a storage-less node. As a result, other resources on the node (such as CPU and memory) aren't usable.
* PWX-3448 When Portworx statistics are exported, they include the volume ID instead of the volume name.
* PWX-3472 When snapshots are triggered on large number of volumes at the same time, the snap operation fails.
* PWX-3528 Volume create option parsing isn't unified across Kubernetes, Docker, and pxctl.
* PWX-3544 Improvements to PX Diagnostics - REST API to retrieve and upload diagnostics for a node or cluster. Diagnostics run using the REST API includes vmstat output and the output of pxctl cluster list and pxctl -j volume list. The diagnostics also include netstat -s before the node went down.
* PWX-3558 px-storage dumps core while running an HA increase on multiple volumes during stress.
* PWX-3577 When Portworx is running in a container environment, it should allow mounts on only those directories which are bind mounted. Otherwise, Portworx hangs during a docker stop.
* PWX-3585 If Portworx stops before a container that's using its volume stops, the container mght get stuck in the D state (I/O in kernel). As a result 'systemctl stop docker' takes 10 minutes as does system shutdown. The default PXD_TIMEOUT to error out IOs is 10 minutes, but should be configurable.
* PWX-3591 Storage isn't rebalanced after a drive add operation and before exiting maintenance mode.
* PWX-3600 Volume HA update operations on snapshots cannot be canceled.
* PWX-3602 Removing a node from a cluster fails with the message "Could not find any volumes that match ID(s)".
* PWX-3606 Portworx metrics now include the following: Disk read and write latency stats, volume read and write latency stats, and per process stats for CPU and virtual/resident memory.
* PWX-3612 When creating or updating a volume, disallow ability to set both the "shared" and "scale" options.
* PWX-3614 A volume inspect returns the wrong error message when one node in the cluster is down: Could not find any volumes that match ID(s).
* PWX-3620 The volume inspect command doesn't show the replication set status, such as whether the replication set has down members or is in a clean or resync state.
* PWX-3632 After a Kubernetes pod terminates and the Portworx volume unmount/cleanup fails, the kubelet logs include "Orphaned pod &lt;name&gt; found, but volume paths are still present on disk."
* PWX-3648 After all nodes in a cluster go offline: If a node doesn't restart when the other nodes restart, the other restarting nodes don't mark that node as offline.
* PWX-3665 The Portworx live core collection hangs sometimes.
* PWX-3666 The pxctl service diags command doesn't store all diagnostics for all nodes in the same lcoation. All diagnostics should appear in /var/cores.
* PWX-3672 The watch function stops after a large time change, such as 7 hours, on the cluster.
* PWX-3678 The pxctl volume update command interprets the -s option as -shared instead of -size and displays the message "invalid shared flag".
* PWX-3700 Multiple alerts appear after a drive add succeeds.
* PWX-3701 The alert raised when a node enters maintenance mode specifes the node index instead of the node ID.
* PWX-3704 After backing up a volume that's in maintenance mode to the cloud, restoring the volume to any online node fails.
* PWX-3709 High CPU usage occurs while detaching a volume with MySQL in Docker Swarm mode.
* PWX-3743 In the service alerts output in the CLI, the Description items aren't aligned.
* PWX-3746 When a Portworx upgrade requires a node reboot, the message "Upgrade done" shouldn't print.
* PWX-3747 When a node exits from maintenance mode, it doesn't generate an alert.
* PWX-3764 The px-runc install command on a coreOS node fails to configure the PX OCI service and generates the error "invalid cross-device link".
* PWX-3777 When running under Kubernetes, pods using a shared volume aren't available after the volume becomes read-only.
* PWX-3778 After adding a drive to a storage-less node fails: A second attempt succeeds but there is no message that the drive add succeeded.
* PWX-3793 When running in Kubernetes, if an unmount fails for a shared volume with the error "volume not mounted", the volume is stuck in a terminating state.
* PWX-3817 When running under Kubernetes, a WordPress pod is stuck in terminating for almost ten minutes.
* PWX-3820 When running Portworx as a Docker V2 plugin: After a service create --replicas command, a volume is mounted locally on a MySQL container instead of a Portworx container. The Swarm service fails with the error "404 Failed to locate volume: Cannot locate volume". To avoid this issue, you can now specify the volume-driver with the service create command.
* PWX-3825 When a node is in a storage down state because the pool is out of capacity: A drive add fails with the error "Drive add start failed. drive size &lt;size&gt; too big" during an attempt to add the same size disk.
* PWX-3829 Container status in the Portworx Lighthouse GUI isn't updated properly from Portworx nodes.
* PWX-3843 Portworx stats include metrics for utilized and available bytes, but not for total bytes (px\_cluster\_disk\_total_bytes). As a result, alerts can't be generated in Prometheus for storage utilization.
* PWX-3844 When you add a snapshot schedule to a volume, the alert type is "Snapshot Interval update failure" instead of "Snapshot interval update success".
* PWX-3850 If the allocated io\_priority differs from the requested io_priority, no associated alert is generated.
* PWX-3851 When two Postgres pods attempted to use the same volume, one of the Postgres pods mounted a local volume instead of a Portworx volume.
* PWX-3859 After adding a volume template to an Auto Scaling Group and Portworx adds tags to the volume: If you stop that cluster and then start a new cluster with the same volume, without removing the tags, a message indicates that the cluster is already initialized. The message should indicate that it failed to attach template volumes because the tag is already used. You can then manually remove the tags from the stopped cluster.
* PWX-3862 A volume is stuck in the detaching state indefinitely due to an issue in etcd.
* PWX-3867 When running under Kubernetes, a pod using namespace volumes generates the messages "Orphaned pod &lt;pod&gt; found, but volume paths are still present on disk".
* PWX-3868 A PX cluster shows an extra node when running with ASG templates enabled if the AWS API returns an error when the PX container is booting up.
* PWX-3871 Added support for dot and hyphen in source and destination names in Kubernetes inline spec for snapshots.
* PWX-3873 When running under Kubernetes, a volume detach fails on a regular volume, with the message "Failed to detach volume: Failed with status -16", and px-storage dumps core.
* PWX-3875 After volume unmount and mount commands are issued in a quick succession, sometimes the volume mount fails.
* PWX-3878 When running under Kubernetes, a Postgres pod gets stuck in a terminating state during when the POD gets deleted.
* PWX-3879 During volume creation on Kubernetes, node labels aren't applied on Kubernetes nodes.
* PWX-3888 An HA increase doesn't use the node value specified in the command if the node is from a different region.
* PWX-3895 The pxctl volume list command shows a volume but volume inspect cannot find it.
* PWX-3902 If a Portworx container is started with the API_SERVER pointing to Lighthouse and etcd servers are also provided, the Portworx container doesn't send statistics to Lighthouse.
* PWX-3906 Orphaned pod volume directories can remain in a Kubernetes cluster after an unmount.
* PWX-3912 During a container umount, namespace volumes might show the error "Device or resource busy".
* PWX-3916 Portworx rack information isn't updated when labels are applied to a Kubernetes node.
* PWX-3933 The size of a volume created by using a REST API call isn't rounded to the 4K boundary.
* PWX-3935 Lighthouse  doesn't show container information when Portworx is run as a Docker V2 plugin.
* PWX-3936 A volume create doesn't ignore storage-less nodes in a cluster and thus fails, because it doesn't allocate the storage to available nodes.
* PWX-3946 On a node where a cloudsnap schedule is configured: If the node gets decommissioned, the schedule isn't configured for the new replica set.
* PWX-3947 Simultaneous mount and unmount likely causes a race in teardown and setup.
* PWX-3968 If Portworx can't find a volume template in an Auto Scaling Group, it dumps core and keeps restarting.
* PWX-3971 Portworx doesn't install on an Azure Ubuntu 14 Distro with 3.13.0-32-generic kernel.
* PWX-3972 When you start a multi-node, multi-zone Auto Scaling Group with a max-count specified, Portworx doesn't start on all nodes.
* PWX-3974 When running under Kubernetes, a WordPress app writes data to the local filesystem after a shared volume remount failure (due to RPC timeout errors) during node start.
* PWX-3997 When running under Kubernetes, deleting Wordpress pods results in orphaned directories.
* PWX-4000 A drive add or replace fails when Portworx is in a storage full/pool offline state.
* PWX-4012 When using shared volumes: During a WordPress plugin installation, the WordPress pod prompts for FTP site permissions. Portworx now passes the correct GID and UUID to WordPress.
* PWX-4049 Adding and removing Kubernetes node labels can fail during node updates.
* PWX-4051 Previous versions of Portworx logged too many "Etcd did not return any transaction responses" messages. That error is now rate-limited to log only a few times.
* PWX-4083 When volume is in a down state due to a create failure, but is still attached without a shared volume export, the detach fails with the error "Mountpath is not mounted".
* PWX-4085 When running under Kubernetes, too many instances of this message get generated: “Kubernetes node watch channel closed. Restarting the watch.."
* PWX-4131 Specifying -a or -A for providing disks to PX needs to handle mpath & raid drives/partitions as well
### Errata

* PWX-3982 After putting a node into maintenance mode, adding drives, and then running "pxctl service m --exit", the message "Maintenance operation is in progress, cancel operation or wait for completion" doesn't specify which operation hasn't completed. Workaround: Use pxctl to query the status of all three drive operations (add, replace, rebalance). pxctl then reports which drive operations are in progress and allows exiting from maintenance mode if all maintenance operations are completed.
* PWX-4014 The pxctl cloudsnap schedule command creates multiple backups for the scheduled time. This issue has no functional impact and will be resolved in the upcoming release.
* PWX-4016 When running under Kubernetes, adding a node label for a scheduled cloudsnap fails with the error "Failed to update k8s node". A node label isn't needed for cloudsnaps because they are read-only and used only for backup to the cloud.
* PWX-4017 An incremental cloudsnap backup command fails with the message "Failed to open snap for backup". Logs indicates that the backup wasn't found on at least on one of the nodes where the volume was provisioned. Workaround: Trigger another backup manually on the nodes that failed.
* PWX-4021 In case of a failure while a read-only snapshot create operation is in progress, Portworx might fail to come back up. This can happen if the failure coincides with snapshot creation's file system freeze step, which is required to fence incoming IOs during the operation. To recover from this issue, reboot the node.
* PWX-4027 Canceling a service drive replace operation fails with the message "Replace cancel failed - Not in progress". However, if you try to exit maintenance mode, the status message indicates that a maintenance operation is in progress. Workaround: Wait for the drive replace operation to finish. The replace operation might be in a state where it can't be canceled. Cancel operations are performed when possible.
* PWX-4039 When running Ubuntu on Azure, an XFS volume format fails. Do not use XFS volumes when running Ubuntu on Azure.
* PWX-4043 When a Portworx POD gets deleted in Kubernetes, no alerts are generated to indicate the POD deletion via kubectl.
* PWX-4050 For a Portworx cluster that's about 100 nodes or greater: If the entire cluster goes down with all the nodes off line, as nodes come on line a few nodes get restarted because they are marked offline. A short while after, the system converges and the entire cluster becomes operational. No user intervention required.
