## 1.0.7 Release Notes

### Key Features
* Continual online drive health monitoring.

### Key Issues addressed
* Fix for Lighthouse reporting some nodes as online when the entire cluster is down.
* Shared volumes can occasionally cause high CPU spikes.  This has been fixed.
* Improvements to the shared volumes throughput.

## 1.0.6 Release Notes

### Key Features 
* Support for Consul

### Key Issues addressed 
* Fix for occasional PX node restart.  Occasionaly during heavy load, a PX node would get marked down by gossip, and asked to restart.  While this did not cause any noticable delay in IO, it would flood the logs with gossip error messages.  This bug has been fixed.
* Minor CLI enhancements around displaying IP addresses instead of node IDs (where possible).
