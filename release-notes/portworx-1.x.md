### Portworx released PX-Enterprise 1.0 on September 15, 2016.

## Summary and features

**"PX" Scale-out fabric for containers**

* PX provides scale-out storage for containers. PX is delivered as a container and turns any server it runs on into a converged storage and compute node.
  * PX aggregates all storage LUNs (local or external) and creates tiers of storage on each node.
  * PX clusters storage across different nodes in the cluster.
  * PX provides virtual volumes at container granularity.  These volumes are accessible and usable on any node in the cluster.
  * PX will run with any Docker scheduler.
  * PX understands different drive and volume types, including cloud volumes such as EBS (provisioned IOPS vs GP vs instance local).

**"Lighthouse" is the Portworx web console to manage multi-tenancy**

* Lighthouse provides storage management for all of your PX-Enterprise deployments, including on-premises clusters and in public clouds.
* Lighthouse monitors health and capacity and lets you provide container-granular storage.
