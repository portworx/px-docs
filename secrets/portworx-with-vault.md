Portworx can integrate with Vault to store your encryption keys/secrets, credentials or passwords. This guide will get a Portworx cluster up which is connected to a Vault endpoint. The vault endpoint could be used to store secrets which will be used for encrypting volumes.

### Setting up Vault
Peruse [this section](https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) for help on setting up Vault in your setup. This includes installation, configuring secrets, etc

### Kubernetes users

If you are installing Portworx on Kubernetes, when generating the [Portworx Kubernetes spec file](http://install.portworx.com/):

1. Use `st=vault` to specify the secret type as "vault"
2. Use `e=KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2` to set [Portworx vault environment variables](#portworx-vault-environment-variables) to identify vault endpoint.

For example:

```
$ curl -o px-spec.yaml \
  "http://install.portworx.com?c=mycluster&k=etcd://etcd.fake.net:2379&st=vault&env=VAULT_ADDR=<vault-address>,VAULT_TOKEN=<vault-token>"
$ kubectl apply -f px-spec.yaml
```

Instructions on generating the Portworx spec for Kubernetes are available [here](/scheduler/kubernetes/install.html).

If you already have a running Portworx installation, [update `/etc/pwx/config.json` on each node](#adding-vault-credentials-to-configjson).

### Docker & Docker plugin users

If you are installing Portworx as a Docker container or a plugin,

1. Use `-secret_type vault -cluster_secret_key <secret-id>` when starting Portworx to specify the secret type as vault and the cluster-wide secret ID.
2. Use `-e` docker option to expose the [Portworx vault environment variables](#portworx-vault-environment-variables)

If you already have a running Portworx installation, [update `/etc/pwx/config.json` on each node](#adding-vault-credentials-to-configjson).

### Portworx vault environment variables
- `VAULT_ADDR=<vault-address>` : It would be used to connect to the Vault endpoint.
- `VAULT_TOKEN=<vault-token>` : This token will be used for authenticating PX with Vault.
- `VAULT_CACERT=</etc/pwx/path>`
- `VAULT_CAPATH=/etc/pwx/path>`
- `VAULT_CLIENT_CERT=</etc/pwx/path>`
- `VAULT_CLIENT_KEY=/etc/pwx/path>`
- `VAULT_TLS_SERVER_NAME=<server-name>`

All the above Vault related fields as well as the cluster secret key can be set using PX CLI which is explained in the next section.

### Adding Vault Credentials to config.json

This section is relevant for either of the below 2 scenarios
- You are deploying PX with your PX configuration created before hand. So you want to create a `/etc/pwx/config.json` before starting Portworx installation.
- You already have a working Portworx cluster so each node already has a `/etc/pwx/config.json`

Add the following `secret_type`, `cluster_secret_key` and `vault` section to the `/etc/pwx/config.json` on each node in the cluster:

```
# cat /etc/pwx/config.json
{
    "clusterid": "<cluster-id>",
    "secret": {
        "secret_type": "vault",
        "cluster_secret_key": "mysecret",
         "vault": {
             "VAULT_TOKEN": "string",
             "VAULT_ADDR": "string"
             "VAULT_CACERT": </etc/pwx/path>,
             "VAULT_CAPATH": </etc/pwx/path>,
             "VAULT_CLIENT_CERT": </etc/pwx/path>,
             "VAULT_CLIENT_KEY": </etc/pwx/path>,
             "VAULT_TLS_SERVER_NAME": <>,
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

### Key generation with Vault

The following sections describe the key generation process with PX and Vault which can be used for encrypting volumes. More info about encrypted volumes [here](/manage/encrypted-volumes.html)

#### Setting cluster wide secret key

A cluster wide secret key is a common key that can be used to encrypt all your volumes. You can set the cluster secret key using the following command.

```
# /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets set-cluster-key
Enter cluster wide secret key: *****
Successfully set cluster secret key!
```
This command needs to be run just once for the cluster.


#### (Optional) Authenticating with Vault using PX CLI

If you do not wish to set Vault environment variables, you can authenticate PX with Vault using PX CLI. Run the following commands:

```
# /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets vault login
Enter VAULT_ADDRESS: <vault-endpoint-address>
Enter VAULT_TOKEN: ********
Successfully authenticated with Vault.
```

>**Important:**<br/> You need to run this command on all PX nodes, so that you could create and mount encrypted volumes on all nodes.

>**Important:**<br/> Make sure that the secret key has been created in Vault.

If the CLI is used to authenticate with Vault, for every restart of PX container it needs to be re-authenticated with Vault by running the `login` command.
