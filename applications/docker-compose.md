Docker Compose provides a simple powerful way of quickly deploying application stacks. Version 2 of Compose provides the ability to use PX volume drivers in one of the following ways:

* Create new volumes on the fly
* Reuse existing volumes

Here's a sample docker-compose.yml file that brings up a wordpress and mysql stack together:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
   db:
     image: mysql:5.7
     volumes:
       - sqlvol:/var/lib/mysql
     restart: always
     environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: wordpress
       MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
       MYSQL_USER: wordpress
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress

   wordpress:
     depends_on:
       - db
     image: wordpress:latest
     ports:
       - "8000:80"
     restart: always
     volumes:
      - wpvol:/var/www/html
     environment:
       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
volumes:
  wpvol:
    driver: pxd
    external: false
    driver_opts:
       size: 7
       repl: 3
  sqlvol:
    driver: pxd
    external: false
    driver_opts:
       size: 6
       repl: 3
```

After `docker-compose up -d`, the following volumes are automatically created through docker-compose, through the existence of `external: false`. You can also create volumes out of band with `pxctl`, and reference them with `external: true`.

```
[root@PX-SM3 ~]# pxctl v l
ID          NAME        SIZE    HA       SHARED STATUS
274113421587995748  wp_wpvol    7.0 GiB 1   no  up - attached on 93a68f30-edcf-4ef4-9122-1b4e0be6ce8b
517652068653682856  wp_sqlvol   6.0 GiB 1   no  up - attached on 93a68f30-edcf-4ef4-9122-1b4e0be6ce8b
```

To bring down the stack, use `docker-compose down --volumes` to remove any volumes that were automatically created.
