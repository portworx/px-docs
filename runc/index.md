## Why runC

Running Portworx as a runC container eliminates any cyclical dependancies between a Docker container consuming storage from the Portworx container.  It also enables you to run your Linux containers without a Docker daemon completely, while still getting all of the advantages of a Linux container and cloud native storage from Portworx.

To install and configure PX to run directly with runC, please use the configuration steps described in this section.

>**Note:**<br/>It is highly recommended to include the steps outlined in this document in a systemd unit file, so that PX starts up correctly on every reboot of a host.  An example unit file is shown below.

## Prerequisites

* *SYSTEMD*: The installation below assumes the [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) package is installed on your system (i.e. `systemctl` command works).
    - Note, if you are running Ubuntu 16.04, CentoOS 7 or CoreOS v94 (or newer) the "systemd" is already installed and no actions will be required.
* *SCHEDULERS*: If you are installing PX into `Kubernetes` or `Mesosphere DC/OS` cluster, we recommend to install the scheduler-specific Portworx package, which provides tighter integration, and better overall user experience.
* *FIREWALL*: Ensure ports 9001-9015 are open between the cluster nodes that will run Portworx.
* *NTP*: Ensure all nodes running PX are time-synchronized, and NTP service is configured and running.
* *KVDB*: Please have a clustered key-value database (etcd or consul) installed and ready. For etcd installation instructions refer this [doc](/maintain/etcd.html).
* *STORAGE*: At least one of the PX-nodes should have extra storage available, in a form of unformatted partition or a disk-drive.<br/> Also please note that storage devices explicitly given to Portworx (ie. `px-runc ... -s /dev/sdb -s /dev/sdc3`) will be automatically formatted by PX.

## Install

The installation and setup of PX OCI bundle is a 3-step process:

1. Install PX OCI bits
2. Configure PX OCI
3. Enable and start Portworx service

<a name="install_step1"></a>
### Step 1: Install the PX OCI bundle
Portworx provides a Docker based installation utility to help deploy the PX OCI
bundle.  This bundle can be installed by running the following Docker container
on your host system:

```bash
# Get latest stable release tag (ie. portworx/px-enterprise:1.2.11.6)
$ latest_stable=$(curl -fsSL 'https://install.portworx.com?type=dock' | awk '/image: / {print $2}')

# Download OCI bits (reminder, you will still need to run `px-runc install ..` after this step)
$ sudo docker run --entrypoint /runc-entry-point.sh \
    --rm -i --privileged=true \
    -v /opt/pwx:/opt/pwx -v /etc/pwx:/etc/pwx \
    $latest_stable
```

>**Note:**<br/>Running the PX OCI bundle does not require Docker, but Docker will still be required to _install_ the PX OCI bundle.  If you do not have Docker installed on your target hosts, you can download this Docker package and extract it to a root tar ball and manually install the OCI bundle.

### Step 2: Configure PX under runC

Now that you have downloaded and installed the PX OCI bundle, you can use the the `px-runc install` command from the bundle to configure `systemd` to start PX runC.

The `px-runc` command is a helper-tool that does the following:

1. prepares the OCI directory for runC
2. prepares the runC configuration for PX
3. used by `systemd` to start the PX OCI bundle

Installation examples:

```bash
# EXAMPLE-1: Basic installation
$ sudo /opt/pwx/bin/px-runc install -c MY_CLUSTER_ID \
    -k etcd://myetc.company.com:2379 \
    -s /dev/xvdb -s /dev/xvdc

# EXAMPLE-2: Installation configured for Kubernetes:
$ sudo /opt/pwx/bin/px-runc install -c MY_CLUSTER_ID \
    -k etcd://myetc.company.com:2379 \
    -s /dev/xvdb -s /dev/xvdc -x kubernetes \
    -v /var/lib/kubelet:/var/lib/kubelet:shared
```

#### Command-line arguments to PX runC

The following arguments can be provided to the `px-runc` helper tool, which will in turn pass them to the PX daemon:

```
Usage: /opt/pwx/bin/px-runc install [options]
```

{% include cmdargs.md %}

#### Examples:
```
px-runc run -k etcd://my.company.com:4001 -c MY_CLUSTER_ID -s /dev/sdc -s /dev/sdb2
px-runc install -k etcd://70.0.1.65:2379 -c MY_CLUSTER_ID -s /dev/sdc -d enp0s8 -m enp0s8
px-runc install -k etcd://70.0.1.65:2379 -c MY_CID -f -a -x kubernetes -v /var/lib/kubelet:/var/lib/kubelet:shared
```

#### Modifying the PX configuration

Since PX OCI bundle has _two_ configuration files, it is recommended to initially install the bundle by using the `px-runc install ...` command as described above, rather than supplying custom configuration files.

After the initial installation, you can modify the following files and restart the PX runC container:

* PX configuration file at `/etc/pwx/config.json` (see [details](https://docs.portworx.com/control/config-json.html)), or
* OCI spec file at `/opt/pwx/oci/config.json` (see [details](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/spec.md)).

### Step 3: Starting PX runC
Once you install the PX OCI bundle and `systemd` configuration from the steps above, you can start and control PX runC directly via `systemd`:

```bash
# Reload systemd configurations, enable and start Portworx service
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable portworx
$ sudo systemctl start portworx
```

## Upgrading the PX OCI bundle

To upgrade the OCI bundle, please re-run the [installation Step 1](#install_step1) with the `--upgrade` option.
After the upgrade, you will need to restart the Portworx service.

<!--EDITING NOTE: DO NOT correct the "?type=dock" below; test the commands before modifying-->
```bash
$ latest_stable=$(curl -fsSL 'https://install.portworx.com?type=dock' | awk '/image: / {print $2}')
$ sudo docker run --entrypoint /runc-entry-point.sh \
    --rm -i --privileged=true \
    -v /opt/pwx:/opt/pwx -v /etc/pwx:/etc/pwx \
    $latest_stable --upgrade
$ sudo systemctl restart portworx
```

<a name="upgrading-from-px-containers-to-px-oci"></a>
## Migrating from PX-Containers to PX-OCI
If you already had PX running as a Docker container and now want to upgrade to runC, follow these instructions:

Step 1: Download and deploy the PX OCI bundle

<!--EDITING NOTE: DO NOT correct the "?type=dock" below; test the commands before modifying-->
```bash
$ latest_stable=$(curl -fsSL 'https://install.portworx.com?type=dock' | awk '/image: / {print $2}')
$ sudo docker run --entrypoint /runc-entry-point.sh \
    --rm -i --privileged=true \
    -v /opt/pwx:/opt/pwx -v /etc/pwx:/etc/pwx \
    $latest_stable
```

Step 2: Inspect your existing PX-Containers, record arguments and any custom mounts:

Inspect the mounts so these can be provided to the runC installer.

>**Note:**<br/>Mounts for `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/etc/pwx`, `/opt/pwx`, `/run/docker/plugins`, `/usr/src`, `/var/cores`, `/var/lib/osd`, `/var/run/docker.sock` can be safely ignored (omitted).<br/>Custom mounts will need to be passed to PX-OCI in the next step, using the following notation:<br/>`px-runc install -v <Source1>:<Destination1>[:<Propagation1 if shared,ro>] ...`

```bash
# Inspect Arguments
{% raw %}$ sudo docker inspect --format '{{.Args}}' px-enterprise {% endraw %}
[ -c MY_CLUSTER_ID -k etcd://myetc.company.com:2379 -s /dev/xvdb ]

# Inspect Mounts
{% raw %}$ sudo docker inspect --format '{{json .Mounts}}' px-enterprise | python -mjson.tool {% endraw %}
[...]
    {
        "Destination": "/var/lib/kubelet",
        "Mode": "shared",
        "Propagation": "shared",
        "RW": true,
        "Source": "/var/lib/kubelet",
        "Type": "bind"
    },
```

Step 3: Install the PX OCI bundle

Remember to use the arguments from your PX Docker installation.

```bash
$ sudo /opt/pwx/bin/px-runc install -c MY_CLUSTER_ID \
    -k etcd://myetc.company.com:2379 \
    -s /dev/xvdb
```

Step 4: Stop PX-Container and start PX runC

```bash
# Disable and stop PX Docker container
$ sudo docker update --restart=no px-enterprise
$ sudo docker stop px-enterprise

# Set up and start PX OCI as systemd service
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable portworx
$ sudo systemctl start portworx
```

Once you confirm the PX Container -> PX runC upgrade worked, you can permanently delete the `px-enterprise` docker container.


## Uninstalling the PX OCI bundle

To uninstall the PX OCI bundle, please run the following:

```bash
# 1: Remove systemd service (if any)
$ sudo systemctl stop portworx
$ sudo systemctl disable portworx
$ sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/portworx*.service

# NOTE: if the steps below fail, please reboot the node, and repeat the steps 2..5

# 2: Unmount oci (if required)
$ grep -q '/opt/pwx/oci /opt/pwx/oci' /proc/self/mountinfo && sudo umount /opt/pwx/oci

# 3: Remove binary files
$ sudo rm -fr /opt/pwx

# 4: [OPTIONAL] Remove configuration files
$ sudo rm -fr /etc/pwx
```

## Logging and Log files

The [systemd(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) uses a very flexible logging mechanism, where logs can be viewed using the `journalctl` command.

For example:

```bash
# Monitor the Portworx logs
$ sudo journalctl -f -u portworx

# Get a slice of Portworx logs
$ sudo journalctl -u portworx --since 09:00 --until "1 hour ago"
```

However, if you prefer to capture Portworx service logs in a separate log file, you will need to modify your host system as follows:

```bash
# Create a rsyslogd(8) rule to separate out the PX logs:
$ sudo cat > /etc/rsyslog.d/23-px-runc.conf << _EOF
:programname, isequal, "px-runc" /var/log/portworx.log
& stop
_EOF

# Create logrotate(8) configuration to periodically rotate the logs:
$ sudo cat > /etc/logrotate.d/portworx << _EOF
/var/log/portworx.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    notifempty
    missingok
    postrotate
        /usr/bin/pkill -HUP syslogd 2> /dev/null || true
    endscript
}
_EOF

# Signal syslogd to reload the configurations:
$ sudo pkill -HUP syslogd
```
