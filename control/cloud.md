### Cloud operations
Help for specific cloudsnap commands can be found by running the following command

Note: All cloudsnap operations requires secrets login to configured endpoint with/without encryption. Please refer pxctl secrets cmd help.

Also refer to [https://docs.portworx.com/control/credentials.html](/control/credentials.html) for configuring cloud provider credentials

#### pxctl cloudsnap --help
```

     list, l           List snapshot in cloud
     status, s         Report status of active backups/restores
     stop, st          stop an active backup/restore

#### pxctl cloudsnap backup
`pxctl cloudsnap backup` command is used to backup a single volume to the configured cloud provider through credential command line. 
If it will be the first backup for the volume a full backup of the volume is generated. If it is not the first backup, it only generates an incremental backup from the previous full/incremental backup.
If a single cloud provider credential is created then there is no need to specify the credentials on the command line.
```
sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cloudsnap backup vol1
Cloudsnap backup started successfully
```
If multiple cloud providers credentials are created then need to specify the credential to use for backup on command line
```
sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cloudsnap backup vol1 --cred-uuid ffffffff-ffff-ffff-1111-ffffffffffff 
Cloudsnap backup started successfully
```
Note: All cloudsnap backup/Restores can be monitored through CloudSnap status command which is described in following sections

#### pxctl cloudsnap restore
`pxctl cloudsnap restore` command is used to restore a successful backup from cloud. (Use cloudsnap list command to get the cloudsnap Id). It requires cloudsnap Id (to be restored) and credentials. 
Restore happens on any node in the cluster where storage can be provisioned. In this release, restored volume will be of replication factor 1. 
This volume can be updated to different repl factors using volume ha-update command.
```
sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cloudsnap restore --snap gossip12/181112018587037740-545317760526242886
Cloudsnap restore started successfully: 315244422215869148
```
Note: All cloudsnap backup/Restores can be monitored through CloudSnap status command which is described in following sections

#### pxctl cloudsnap status
`pxctl cloudsnap status` can be used to check the status of cloudsnap operations
```
sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cloudsnap status
SOURCEVOLUME		   STATE		      BYTES-PROCESSED	TIME-ELAPSED		COMPLETED			            ERROR

```

#### pxctl cloudsnap list
`pxctl cloudsnap list` is used to list all the cloud snapshots
```
sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cloudsnap list --cred-uuid ffffffff-ffff-ffff-1111-ffffffffffff --all
SOURCEVOLUME 			CLOUD-SNAP-ID									CREATED-TIME				STATUS
vol1			gossip12/181112018587037740-545317760526242886		Sun, 09 Apr 2017 14:35:28 UTC		Done
```
Filtering on cluster ID or volume ID is available and can be done as follows:
```
sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl cloudsnap list --cred-uuid ffffffff-ffff-ffff-1111-ffffffffffff --src vol1
