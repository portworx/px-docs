The Portworx command-line tool, `pxctl`, is available on every node where PX is running.  It is available at the host at `/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl`.  The CLI is designed to accept and display human readable input and output by default.  In addition, every command takes in a `-j` option such that the output is in machine parsable `json` format.

In most production deployments, you will provision volumes directly using Docker or your scheduler (such as a Kubernetes pod spec).  However, pxctl also lets you directly provision and manage storage. In addition, the pxctl has a rich set of cluster wide management features which are explained in this document.

All operations from `pxctl` are reflected back into the containers that use Portworx storage. In addition to what is exposed in Docker volumes, `pxctl`:

* Gives access to Portworx storage-specific features, such as cloning a running container's storage.
* Shows the connection between containers and their storage volumes.
* Let you control the Portworx storage cluster, such as adding nodes to the cluster. (The Portworx tools refer to servers managed by Portworx storage as *nodes*.)

The scope of the `pxctl` command is global to the cluster. Running `pxctl` from any node within the cluster therefore shows the same global details. `pxctl` also identifies details specific to that node.

This current release of `pxctl` requires that you run as a privileged user.  The `pxctl` tool is available in the `/opt/pwx/bin/` directory. To run `pxctl` without typing the full directory path each time, add `pxctl` to your PATH as follows:

```
# sudo su
# export PATH=/opt/pwx/bin:$PATH
```

`pxctl` provides capabilities to perform much more fine-grained control of the PX resources cluster-wide and as seen above offers capabilties to manage volumes, snapshots, cluster resources, hosts in the cluster and software upgrade in the cluster.

Now you can just type `pxctl` and you're ready to start.

### Status
The status command gives summary like node details, cluster members, global storage capacity etc.

```
# sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status
```

The following sample output of `pxctl status` shows that the global capacity for Docker containers is 192 GB.

```
# /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status

### Upgrade related operations
```
sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl upgrade --help
NAME:
   pxctl upgrade - Upgrade PX

USAGE:
   pxctl upgrade [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --tag value, -l value  Specify a PX Docker image tag (default: "latest")

```

#### pxctl upgrade
`pxctl upgrade` upgrades the PX version on a node. Note: the container name also needs to be specified in the CLI.
```
sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl upgrade --tag 1.1.6 my-px-enterprise
Upgrading my-px-enterprise to version: portworx/px-enterprise:1.1.6
Downloading PX portworx/px-enterprise:1.1.6 layers...
<Output truncated>
```
It is recommended to upgrade the nodes in a staggered manner so as to maintain quorum and continuity of IOs.

### Login/Authentication
You must make PX login to the secrets endpoint when using encrypted volumes and ACLs.

`pxctl secrets` can be used to configure authentication credentials and endpoints - Vault, Amazon KMS, KVDB are currently supported.
Vault example (Note: To install and configure Vault, peruse [this link](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/index.html)
```
# sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets vault login --vault-address http://myvault.myorg.com --vault-token myvaulttoken
Successfully authenticated with Vault.
```
AWS KMS example
```
# sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets aws login
Enter AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID [Hit Enter to ignore]: ***
Enter AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY [Hit Enter to ignore]: ***
Enter AWS_SECRET_TOKEN_KEY [Hit Enter to ignore]: ***
Enter AWS_CMK [Hit Enter to ignore]: mykey
Enter AWS_REGION [Hit Enter to ignore]: us-east-1b
Successfully authenticated with AWS.
```
